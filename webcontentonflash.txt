1. Create a new file in the Arduino IDE named index.h
2. Put this inside it:
CODE: SELECT ALL
const char MAIN_page[] PROGMEM = R"=====(
/// Your entire webpage here. (Can be multi-line)
)=====";

3. Make sure you save it, and import it in your main sketch file:
CODE: SELECT ALL
#import "index.h"

4. Now to serve the web-page, simply do this:
CODE: SELECT ALL
httpServer.send(200, "text/html", MAIN_page);
